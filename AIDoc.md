### 6.1 - Enemy AI ###

Enemy AI will vary among different enemy types, based on their intended difficulty, as well as their weapons and movement abilities.
The most basic/beginner enemies will simply move back and forth unless killed. More advanced enemies will have their own weapons,
and will have be able to move toward or away from the enemy, depending on the combat style they are programmed with.
The level of sophistication for both movement and weapon use will increase as the game progresses, with the most complex behaviour
reserved for bosses. Each boss will have their own hard-coded behaviour that suits their weapon and movement capabilities, 
in order to give each level-ending boss fight a unique feel, creating a more memorable experience.
