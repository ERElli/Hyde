The "powerUp" class defines those usable items that modify the player's stats directly.
This includes their health, shields, speed, mass, etc.
It does not define any new methods, but implements the modifyAttribute method from the "usable" interface 
by calling the modifyStat method in the "player" class

Attributes:
<ul>
  <li>increaseAmount</li>
  <li>effectedStat</li>
</ul>
