The "weapon" class defines those usable items that modify the player's current weapon.
This effects the damage, pattern, bullet speed, and firing rate of the shooting mechanic.
It does not define any new methods, but implements the modifyAttribute method from the "usable" interface 
by calling the changeWeapon method in the "player" class

Attributes:
<ul>
  <li>firingRate</li>
  <li>bulletSpeed</li>
  <li>damage</li>
  <li>pattern</li>
</ul>
