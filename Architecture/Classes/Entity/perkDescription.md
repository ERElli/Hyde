The "perk" class defines those usable items that give the player some unique bonus, not directly effecting their stats.
This includes, but is not limited to, giving the player temporary shields, refilling their ammo, and making their bullets explosive.
It does not define any new methods, but implements the modifyAttribute method from the "usable" interface 
by calling the addPerk method in the "player" class

Attributes:
<ul>
  <li>name</li>
</ul>
