Database Classes: 

1.The login class will validate the username and password that the user inputs in the interface login menu. The login class will connect to the database and check to see if the combination of username and password is stored on the database and returns true if it is. In the case where the combination of username or password is wrong, an error message will be displayed.

2. The create account class will add a new user's information to the database. In order to create a new account a user must enter his username, password, first name, last name, and email. His/her username and password will be added to the login database and the full information will be added to the Profile class which we will discuss below.
