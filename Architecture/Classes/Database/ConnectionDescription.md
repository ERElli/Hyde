Database Classes: 

The login class will validate the username and password that the user inputs in the interface login menu. The login class will connect to the database and check to see if the combination of username and password is stored on the database and returns true if it is. In the case where the combination of username or password is wrong, an error message will be displayed. 


2. Modify DataBase: this class modifies data in the database based on the user's interactions in the interface; for example update password, update achievement, level. 

3. SaveLevelDB: this class saves the level created by the user.
