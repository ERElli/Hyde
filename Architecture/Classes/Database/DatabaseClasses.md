Database Classes: 

1.The Users class will validate the username and password that the user inputs in the interface login menu. The login class will connect to the database and check to see if the  username is taken or not. In the case where the combination of username or password is wrong, an error message will be displayed. The Users class also inserts new users into the database and reset the password for the user if requested.

2. The Account Progress class will update  the user's progress and achievement in the game and store it in the database. The  data is retrieved when the user is viewing their profile on the interface. The data stored is updated as the user progresses in the game.
